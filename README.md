# Scitimes Sources

A chrome extension that checks NYT articles for links to peer-reviewed journals
and displays information about them at the top of the page.

## Installation

Until I submit this to the chrome extension gallery, you will need to pull the
code and load this as an unpacked extension. Go to `chrome://extensions/`, turn
on "developer mode," click "Load unpacked," and select the scitimes-sources folder.
